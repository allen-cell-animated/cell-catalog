footer_text: All cell lines were originally generated using the WTC-11 hiPS cell
  line as the parental cell line. Access whole genome sequence data (100X
  coverage) for the WTC-11 line on the [Genomics](https://www.allencell.org/genomics.html) page. The donor of the WTC line
  has consented to the sharing of this data.

The Disease Collection Cell Catalog is a growing compilation of cell lines that carry mutations in genes known to cause disease. These cell lines were created by introducing a point mutation in one of the fluorescently tagged WTC-11 clonal lines from the [Allen Cell Collection](https://www.allencell.org/cell-catalog.html).
