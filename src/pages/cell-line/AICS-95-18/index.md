    - caption: Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged EZH2.
        Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3
        min. A single mid-level plane is shown. Bleaching was corrected using
        the histogram matching method in ImageJ. Movie plays at 1800x real time.
        Scale bar, 20 µm.

      caption: Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged EZH2. Cells
        were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope and are shown
        here with the despeckle ImageJ filter applied. Movie starts at the
        bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5 μm.
