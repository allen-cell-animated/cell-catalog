      caption: "Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Nucleoporin Nup153 protein. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Nucleoporin Nup153 protein. Cells were imaged in a 3D volume spanning ~1.5 µm through the middle of the cells on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. A single mid-level z-section is shown. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."
