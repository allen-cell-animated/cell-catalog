      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colonies expressing the CAAX domain of K-Ras tagged with mEGFP from a safe harbor locus. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. Image is a single z-plane near the bottom of the cells. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 10 µm."
