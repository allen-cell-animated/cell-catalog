  junction_table_caption: "PCR amplified 3' junction was used to establish delivery via HDR at the intended genomic locus. Tiled junctions were not possible to amplify or sequence due to the large size of the delivered sequence (6KB). The precise sequence of the delivered sequence was not determined because the mTag-RFP-T tag sequence was not fused to an endogenous coding sequence."
