      caption: "Single-planes of live hiPS cell colony expressing the CAAX domain of K-Ras tagged with mEGFP expressed from a safe harbor locus. Z-planes shown are at the bottom (left), middle (middle) and top (right) of cells. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5µm. "

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colonies expressing the CAAX domain of K-Ras tagged with mEGFP from a safe harbor locus. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. Image is a single z-plane near the bottom of the cells. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 10 µm."
