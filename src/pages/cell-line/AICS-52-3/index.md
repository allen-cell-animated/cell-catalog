      caption: "Single, mid-level plane of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged MLC-2a protein. Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI and laminin coated glass and imaged in 3D on a spinning disk confocal microscope 20 days later (32 days total after the onset of differentiation). Scale bar, 10 µm. "

      caption: "Z-stack of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged MLC-2a. Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI and laminin coated glass and imaged in 3D on a spinning disk confocal microscope 20 days later (32 days total after the onset of differentiation). Cells were treated with 15 mM of the myosin inhibitor 2,3-Butanedione monoxime (BDM) to prevent beating during image acquisition. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Inset shows detail of MLC-2a in myofibrils. Scale bars, 10 µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged MLC-2a protein. Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI and laminin coated glass and imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope 19 days later (31 days total after the onset of differentiation). A single plane of cells was imaged continuously with a 100 ms exposure time. Inset shows detail of MLC-2a in myofibrils. Scale bars, 10 µm. Movie plays in real time."
