      caption: "Z-stack of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged MLC-2v. Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI- and laminin-coated glass and imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope 28 days later (40 days total after the onset of differentiation). Cells were treated with 20 mM of the myosin inhibitor 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) to prevent beating during image acquisition. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Inset is a 3x enlargement of the boxed region to show detail of MLC-2v in myofibrils. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 20 µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged MLC-2v protein. Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI and laminin coated glass and imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope 28 days later (40 days total after the onset of differentiation). A single plane of cells was imaged continuously with a 100 ms exposure time. Inset is a 3x enlargement of the boxed region to show detail of MLC-2v in myofibrils. Movie plays in real time.Scale bar, 20 µm."
