      caption: "Single, mid-level plane of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged MLC-2v protein. Representative high-expressing, relatively mature cell is shown surrounded by more immature cells with lower expression levels (the culture contains cells of varying levels of maturity). Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI and laminin coated glass and imaged in 3D on a spinning disk confocal microscope 47 days later (59 days total after the onset of differentiation). Scale bars, 10 μm."

      caption: "Z-stack of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged MLC-2v. Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI- and laminin-coated glass and imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope 28 days later (40 days total after the onset of differentiation). Cells were treated with 20 mM of the myosin inhibitor 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) to prevent beating during image acquisition. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Inset is a 3x enlargement of the boxed region to show detail of MLC-2v in myofibrils. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 20 µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing mEGFP-tagged MLC-2v protein. Twelve days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated on PEI and laminin coated glass and imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope 28 days later (40 days total after the onset of differentiation). A single plane of cells was imaged continuously with a 100 ms exposure time. Inset is a 3x enlargement of the boxed region to show detail of MLC-2v in myofibrils. Movie plays in real time.Scale bar, 20 µm."

          caption: "Junctional PCR primers complementary to sequences flanking the homology arms in the distal genome were used together to co-amplify tagged and untagged alleles. Gel shows untagged allele (smaller band) and tagged allele (larger band) from single PCR reaction. A band intermediate in size between the anticipated tagged and untagged allele products is consistently observed and is a hypothesized heteroduplex of the tagged and untagged allele products.
