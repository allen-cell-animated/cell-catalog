      caption: "Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged connexin-43. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged connexin-43. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3.25 min. Image is a maximum intensity projection of 20 z-sections (5.51 µm) acquired at the top of the cells. Contrast is enhanced to show localization of connexin-43 to internal structures Frames were histogram matched to adjust for photobleaching. Movie plays at 975x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged connexin-43. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. Image is a maximum intensity projection through the entire cell volume. Contrast is enhanced to show localization of connexin-43 to internal structures. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 10 µm."
