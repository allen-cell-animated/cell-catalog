      caption: Single image of a live hiPS cell colony expressing two copies (biallelic) of mEGFP tagged sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL 1) imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Image is a maximum intensity projection of a 3D z-stack.

      caption: Viability and colony formation photographed 3 days post-thaw at 4X magnification. Cells were treated with ROCK inhibitor for 24 hrs post-thaw.

      caption: Z-stack of live hiPS cells expressing two copies (biallelic) of mEGFP tagged sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL 1) imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top.

      caption: Timelapse movie of live hiPS cells expressing two copies (biallelic) of mEGFP tagged sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL 1). Images were taken in 3D every 5 minutes for 100 minutes on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Images are maximum intensity projections with the ‘despeckle’ ImageJ filter applied. Movie sped up 900x over real time.

      caption: Timelapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing two copies (biallelic) of mEGFP tagged sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL 1). Images were taken in 3D every 3 minutes for 6 hours on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Images are maximum intensity projections with the ‘despeckle’ ImageJ filter applied. Movie sped up 1800x over real time.
