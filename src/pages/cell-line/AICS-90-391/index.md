      caption: Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB.
        TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB (left) and overlay onto transmitted light image
        stack (right) are shown. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk
        confocal. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top.
