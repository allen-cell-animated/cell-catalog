      caption: "Timelapse movie of live hiPS cells expressing mEGFP tagged non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB. Images taken in 3D every 3 minutes for 69 minutes on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Image is a maximum intensity projection of 5 z-slices near the top of the cells. Movie sped up 828x over real time."

      caption: "Timelapse movie of live hiPS cells expressing mEGFP tagged non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB. Images taken in 3D every 3 minutes for 150 minutes on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Left panel is a maximum intensity projection of 3 z-slices near the bottom of the cells. Right panel is overlaid onto the transmitted light image. Movie sped up 1800x over real time."
