      caption: "Single, mid-level plane of cells in a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin, mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin, and HaloTag-tagged nucleolar transcription factor UBF visualized with ligand Janelia Fluor 646 (Promega). Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin, nucleolar transcription factor UBF, nucleophosmin, and an overlay of the three (counterclockwise from top right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5μm."

      caption: "Viability and colony formation one day (a,b) and four days post-thaw (c,d). Flattened, loosely packed cells around colony edges were observed (Fig. 4c, d; see arrows) in many mature stem cell colonies on day 4 post thaw, which is suboptimal. Small clump passaging with Versene improved the colony morphology after 4 passages (Fig. 4e, f; see arrows)."

      caption: "Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin, mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin, and HaloTag-tagged nucleolar transcription factor UBF visualized with ligand Janelia Fluor 646 (Promega). Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin, nucleolar transcription factor UBF, nucleophosmin, and an overlay of the three (counterclockwise from top right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5 µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin, mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin, and HaloTag-tagged nucleolar transcription factor UBF visualized with ligand Janelia Fluor 646 (Promega). Panels show individual channels for nucleolar transcription factor UBF, fibrillarin, nucleophosmin, and an overlay of the three (left to right). Boxed regions in top row are shown enlarged in the bottom row with increased brightness.  Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. A single mid-level plane is shown. Movie plays at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin (pseudocolored in magenta), mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin (pseudocolored in cyan), and HaloTag-tagged nucleolar transcription factor UBF visualized with ligand Janelia Fluor 646 (Promega) (pseudocolored in yellow); overlay of channels appears white where proteins are colocalized. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. A single mid-level plane is shown. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 20 µm."
