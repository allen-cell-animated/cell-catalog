          caption: "Junctional PCR primers complementary to sequences flanking the homology arms in the distal genome were used together to co-amplify tagged and untagged alleles. Gel shows untagged allele (smaller band) and tagged allele (larger band) from single PCR reaction. A band intermediate in size between the anticipated tagged and untagged allele products is consistently observed and is a hypothesized heteroduplex of the tagged and untagged allele products.
