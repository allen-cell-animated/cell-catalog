    - caption: Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged
        TERF2. A single, mid-level plane of the cells was imaged every 3 min on
        a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie plays at 900x real time.
        Scale bar, 5 µm.

    - caption: Z-stack of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged TERF2. Cells
        were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. The movie
        starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5 µm.
