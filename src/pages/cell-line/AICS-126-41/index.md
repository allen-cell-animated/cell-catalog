      caption: "Single, mid-level plane of hiPSC-derived endothelial cells expressing mEGFP-tagged VE-cadherin (scalebar, 20 Âµm). Five days after the onset of differentiation, cells were magnetically sorted using CD144 antibodies and subsequently cryopreserved. Upon thawing, the cells were grown on fibronectin-coated tissue culture plates until they reached confluence. They were then re-plated onto fibronectin-coated glass plates and imaged four days later. Cells were imaged live in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope."

      caption: "One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw-refer to culture protocol). Cultures were observed daily. Colonies were imaged one and three days post-thaw using a Leica microscope at 4x and 10x magnification."
