      caption: "Viability and colony formation post-thaw. a-d: Morphological abnormalities (indicated by black arrows) may be visible post-thaw (5% of population). e-f: Morphology improves the first few passages post-thaw when seeding at 1M/10cm dish for three days and 500K cells/10cm dish for four days. Morphological abnormalities can be seen in 1-5% of colonies in three and four days of growth. Colony morphology will resolve with continued passage. Scale bars are as shown."

    - caption: Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged
        E-cadherin. A single plane near the top of the cells was imaged every 3
        min on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie plays at 900x real
        time. Scale bar, 5 µm.

    - caption: Z-stack of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged E-cadherin.
        Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. The
        movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar,
        5 µm.

    - caption: Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged
        E-cadherin. A small mid-level stack of six z-slices was imaged every 3
        min on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. A maximum intensity
        projection of the six z-slices is shown. Bleaching was corrected using
        the histogram matching method in ImageJ. Movie plays at 1800x real time.
        Scale bar, 5 µm.
