      caption: "Single, mid-level plane of cells in a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Histone H2B type 1-J protein. The cells in the imaged region highlight cell-cycle-dependent changes in localization. The large dim regions within nuclei likely represent nucleoli. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5 µm."
