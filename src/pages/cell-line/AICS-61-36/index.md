      caption: "Single, mid-level plane of cells in a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Histone H2B type 1-J protein. The cells in the imaged region highlight cell-cycle-dependent changes in localization. The large dim regions within nuclei likely represent nucleoli. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5 µm."

          caption: "Junctional PCR primers complementary to sequences flanking the homology arms in the distal genome were used together to co-amplify tagged and untagged alleles. Gel shows untagged allele (smaller band) and tagged allele (larger band) from single PCR reaction. A band intermediate in size between the anticipated tagged and untagged allele products is consistently observed and is a hypothesized heteroduplex of the tagged and untagged allele products. (1% Agarose gel with Thermo Fisher 1kb ladder)."
