      caption: "mEGFP-tagged autophagy-related protein LC3 B localization in an hiPSC colony. Image is a single slice of a 3Dspinning disk confocal z-stack of a live hiPSC colony in the bottom half of the cells. Both untreated cells (left panel) andcells treated for 24 hours with 800nM leupeptin to visualize autophagosomes (right panel) are shown."

      caption: "Z-stacks of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged autophagy-related protein LC3 B in the absence (stack on the left) and presence of 800 nM leupeptin (stack on the right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

      caption: "Timelapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged autophagy-related protein LC3 B in presence of 800 nM leupeptin. Cells were imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 10 seconds. Image is a maximum intensity projection of 4 z-slices acquired through the middle of the cells. Movie sped up 100x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."

          caption: "Junctional PCR primers complementary to sequences flanking the homology arms in the distal genome were used together to co-amplify tagged and untagged alleles. Gel shows untagged allele (smaller band) and tagged allele (larger band) from single PCR reaction. A band intermediate in size between the anticipated tagged and untagged allele products is consistently observed and is a hypothesized heteroduplex of the tagged and untagged allele products. (1% Agarose gel with Thermo Fisher 1kb ladder)."
