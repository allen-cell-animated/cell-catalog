      caption: "hiPS cells expressing mEGFP-tagged Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP-1) in control cells (left panel; single mid-level plane) and in cells treated with 62.5 μM sodium arsenite for 60 minutes (right panel; maximum intensity z-projection). Cells were imaged live in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5 μm."
