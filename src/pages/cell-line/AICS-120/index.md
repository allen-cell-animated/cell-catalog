      caption: One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK
        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw). Cultures were observed daily. Colonies
        were imaged one and three days post-thaw using a Leica microscope at 4x
        and 10x magnification.

      caption: hiPS cells expressing mTagRFP-T-tagged mitochondrial targeting sequence
        of COXVIII (mitoTag). Image is a single slice near the bottom of the
        cell (scalebar, 5 Î¼m). Cells were imaged live in 3D on a spinning-disk
        confocal microscope.
