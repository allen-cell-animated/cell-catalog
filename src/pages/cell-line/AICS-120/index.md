    - caption: hiPS cells expressing mEGFP-tagged outer mitochondrial membrane
        receptor Tom20 (TOMM20) and mTagRFP-T-tagged mitochondrial targeting
        sequence of COXVIII (mitoTag). Image is a single slice near the bottom
        of the cell (scalebar, 5 μm). Inset image is 2x enlargement of boxed
        area to show detailed relationship between tagged proteins. Cells were
        imaged live in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope.

      caption: One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK
        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw). Cultures were observed daily. Colonies
        were imaged one and three days post-thaw using a Leica microscope at 4x
        and 10x magnification.

      caption: "Z-stack of a live hiPS cell colony expressing expressing mEGFP-tagged
        outer mitochondrial membrane receptor Tom20 (TOMM20) and
        mTagRFP-T-tagged mitochondrial targeting sequence of COXVIII (mitoTag).
        The movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top (scale
        bar, 5 µm). Inset image is 2x enlargement of boxed area to show detailed
        relationship between tagged proteins. Cells were imaged live in 3D on a
        spinning-disk confocal microscope. "
