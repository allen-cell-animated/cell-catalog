      caption: "Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged SMC protein 1A. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. A single mid-level plane is shown. Frames were histogram matched to adjust for photobleaching. Movie plays at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."
