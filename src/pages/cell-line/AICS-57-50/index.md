      caption: "Single mid-level plane of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged nucleophosmin. Right panel is the same image as the left but with contrast enhanced to visualize dimmer localization in mitotic cells. Images are maximum intensity projections through the volume of the cells. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5µm. "

          caption: "Junctional PCR primers complementary to sequences flanking the homology arms in the distal genome were used together to co-amplify tagged and untagged alleles. Gel shows untagged allele (smaller band) and tagged allele (larger band) from single PCR reaction. A band intermediate in size between the anticipated tagged and untagged allele products is consistently observed and is a hypothesized heteroduplex of the tagged and untagged allele products. (1% Agarose gel with Thermo Fisher 1kb ladder)."
