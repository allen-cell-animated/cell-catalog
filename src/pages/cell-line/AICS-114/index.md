      caption: Single plane image near the top of hiPS cells expressing mEGFP-tagged E-cadherin. Cells were imaged live in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5 Âµm.

      caption: Viability and colony formation post-thaw. a-d: Morphological abnormalities (indicated by black arrows) may be visible post-thaw (5% of population). e-f: Morphology improves the first few passages post-thaw when seeding at 1M/10cm dish for three days and 500K cells/10cm dish for four days. Morphological abnormalities can be seen in 1-5% of colonies in three and four days of growth. Colony morphology will resolve with continued passage. Scale bars are as shown.
