      caption: "Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing two copies (biallelic) of mEGFP-tagged Ras-related protein Rab-5A imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

      caption: "Timelapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing two copy (biallelic) of mEGFP-tagged Ras-related protein Rab-5A. Cells were imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. A single, mid-level plane was acquired every second. A zoom-in of the area boxed in the left panel is shown on the right. Movie sped up 10x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."
