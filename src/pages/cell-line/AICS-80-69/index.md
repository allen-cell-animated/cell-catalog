      caption: "Single, mid-level plane of cells in a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged RNA-binding protein FUS in control cells (left panel) and in the presence of 500 µM sodium arsenite for 15 min (right panel). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5 µm. "

      caption: "Z-stack of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged RNA-binding protein FUS in control cells (left panel) and in the presence of 500 µM sodium arsenite for 15 min (right panel). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged RNA-binding protein FUS. Six minutes after the introduction of 500 µM sodium arsenite, cells were imaged every 5 sec in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. A single mid-level plane is shown. The inset is a 2.5x enlargement of the boxed region to show detail of aggregate formation. Frames were histogram matched to adjust for photobleaching. Movie plays at 25x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."
