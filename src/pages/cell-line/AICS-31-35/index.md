      caption: "Timelapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mTagRFP-T tagged alpha-tubulin. Images were taken in 3D every 5 minutes for 10 hours on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Images are maximum intensity projections with the ‘despeckle’ ImageJ filter applied. Movie sped up 3000x over real time."
