      caption: "Timelapse movie of live hiPS cells expressing two copies (biallelic) of mEGFP tagged sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL 1). Images were taken in 3D every 5 minutes for 100 minutes on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Images are maximum intensity projections with the ‘despeckle’ ImageJ filter applied. Movie sped up 900x over real time."

Expect absence of WT (untagged) allele because clone 44 has bi-allelic ST6GAL1 mEGFP tag. 5' and 3' junctions were Sanger sequenced to check for precise mEGFP insertion. Primers were designed to exclude amplification from the donor plasmid."
