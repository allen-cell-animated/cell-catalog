      caption: "Timelapse movie of live hiPS cells expressing two copies (biallelic) of mEGFP tagged sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL 1). Images were taken in 3D every 5 minutes for 100 minutes on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Images are maximum intensity projections with the ‘despeckle’ ImageJ filter applied. Movie sped up 900x over real time."

      caption: "Timelapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing two copies (biallelic) of mEGFP tagged sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL 1). Images were taken in 3D every 3 minutes for 6 hours on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Images are maximum intensity projections with the ‘despeckle’ ImageJ filter applied. Movie sped up 1800x over real time."
