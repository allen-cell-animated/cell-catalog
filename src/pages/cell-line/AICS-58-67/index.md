      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged-beta-catenin. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 5 min. Image is a maximum intensity projection through the top 12 z-sections (3.19 µm) of the colony. Frames were histogram matched to adjust for photobleaching. Movie plays at 3000x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."
