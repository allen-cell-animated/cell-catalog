    - caption: Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged
        translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 and mTagRFP-T-tagged
        tubulin-alpha 1b. Panels show individual channels for outer
        mitochondrial membrane 20 (left) and tubulin-alpha 1b (middle) and the
        overlay of the two (right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk
        confocal microscope every 3 min and a single plane is shown. Movie plays
        at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 20 µm.

    - caption: Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged translocase of
        outer mitochondrial membrane 20 and mTagRFP-T-tagged tubulin-alpha 1b.
        Panels show individual channels for translocase of outer mitochondrial
        membrane 20 (left) and tubulin-alpha 1b (middle) and the overlay of the
        two (right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal
        microscope. The movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the
        top. Scale bar, 5µm.
