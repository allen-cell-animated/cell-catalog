        A small mid-level stack of four z-slices was imaged every 3 min on a
        spinning-disk confocal microscope. A maximum intensity projection of the
        four z-slices is shown. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm.

        were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts
        at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm.
