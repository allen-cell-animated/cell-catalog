    - caption: Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged
        E-cadherin. A single plane near the top of the cells was imaged every 3
        min on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie plays at 900x real
        time. Scale bar, 5 µm.

    - caption: Z-stack of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged E-cadherin.
        Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. The
        movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar,
        5 µm.

    - caption: Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged
        E-cadherin. A small mid-level stack of six z-slices was imaged every 3
        min on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. A maximum intensity
        projection of the six z-slices is shown. Movie plays at 1800x real time.
        Scale bar, 5 µm.
