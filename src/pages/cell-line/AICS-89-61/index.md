      caption: "Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin, mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin, and TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB. Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin, nucleophosmin, and the overlay of the two (left to right). TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB is not shown here because it was used to identify dCas9-KRAB expressing cells and not to highlight a structure (see single z-slice image for its expression pattern). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin, mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin, and TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB. Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin, nucleophosmin, and the overlay of the two (left to right). TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB is not shown here because it was used to identify dCas9-KRAB expressing cells and not to highlight a structure (see single z-slice image for its expression pattern). The regions bounded by a dashed line are shown at the same scale with increased brightness to highlight changes in localization during mitosis. A single, mid-level plane of the cells was imaged every 3 min on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie plays at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."
