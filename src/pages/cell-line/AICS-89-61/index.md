      caption: "Single, mid-level plane of cells in a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin, mTagRFP-T-taggednucleophosmin, and TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB. Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin, nucleophosmin, the overlayof the two, and dCas9-KRAB (clockwise from the top left). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope.Scale bar, 5μm."

Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin, nucleophosmin, and the overlay of the two (left to right). TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB is not shown here because it was used to identify dCas9-KRAB expressing cells and not to highlight a structure (see single z-slice image for its expression pattern). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin, nucleophosmin, and the overlay of the two (left to right). TagBFP-tagged dCas9-KRAB is not shown here because it was used to identify dCas9-KRAB expressing cells and not to highlight a structure (see single z-slice image for its expression pattern). The regions bounded by a dashed line are shown at the same scale with increased brightness to highlight changes in localization during mitosis. A single, mid-level plane of the cells was imaged every 3 min on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie plays at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."
