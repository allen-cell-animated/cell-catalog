    - caption: Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged
        CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). A single, mid-level plane of the cells was
        imaged every 3 min on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie plays
        at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm.

    - caption: Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged CCCTC-binding
        factor (CTCF). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal
        microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top.
        Scale bar, 5µm.
