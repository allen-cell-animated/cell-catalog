      caption: "Z-stacks of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged autophagy-related protein LC3 B in the absence (stack on the left) and presence of 800 nM leupeptin (stack on the right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

      caption: "Timelapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged autophagy-related protein LC3 B in presence of 800 nM leupeptin. Cells were imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 10 seconds. Image is a maximum intensity projection of 4 z-slices acquired through the middle of the cells. Movie sped up 100x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."
