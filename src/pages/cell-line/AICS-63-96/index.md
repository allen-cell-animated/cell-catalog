    - caption: Z-stack of live hiPSC-derived skeletal muscle myofibers expressing
        mEGFP-tagged dystrophin imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk microscope.
        Twenty-five days after the onset of differentiation, cells were plated
        on Matrigel (diluted 1:60) coated glass. Cell fusion was induced one day
        later, and muscle fibers were imaged 7 days after fusion induction
        (imaging was performed 33 days total after the onset of
        differentiation). Skeletal muscle sample was courtesy of Shawn Luttrell
        and David Mack (University of Washington). The movie starts at the
        bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 10 Âµm.
