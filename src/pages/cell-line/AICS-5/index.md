      caption: Single image of a live hiPSC colony expressing paxillin-EGFP imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Left panel is a single slice of the z-tack near the bottom of the cell; right panel is this same projection overlaid onto one slice of the same z-stack in the transmitted light channel.
