      caption: "Timelapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mTagRFP-T tagged centrin-2. Images were taken in 3D every 3 minutes for 6 hours on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Images are maximum intensity projections with the ‘despeckle’ ImageJ filter applied. Movie sped up 1800x over real time."
