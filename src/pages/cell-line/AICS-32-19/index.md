          caption: "Junctional PCR primers complementary to sequences flanking the homology arms in the distal genome were used together to amplify tagged allele. Single band corresponding to tagged allele is observed for clone 19. Smaller single band corresponding to the untagged allele is observed in the parental unedited line (WT). NTC: no template control.

Expect absence of WT (untagged) allele because CETN2 is on chrX, and WTC is XY. 5' and 3’ junctions were Sanger sequenced to check for precise mTagRFP-T insertion. Primers were designed to exclude amplification from the donor plasmid."
