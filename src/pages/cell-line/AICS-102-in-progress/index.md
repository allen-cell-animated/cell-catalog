      caption: One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK
        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw). Cultures were observed daily. Colonies
        were imaged one (a,b), three (c,d) and four (e,f) days post-thaw using a
        Leica microscope at 4x and 10x magnification

      caption: hiPS cells expressing mTagRFP-T-tagged mitochondrial targeting sequence
        of COXVIII (mitoTag). Image is a single slice near the bottom of the
        cell (scalebar, 5 μm). Cells were imaged live in 3D on a spinning-disk
        confocal microscope.

      caption: Z-stack of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mTagRFP-T-tagged
        mitochondrial targeting sequence of COXVIII (mitoTag). The movie starts
        at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top (scale bar, 5 µm). Cells
        were imaged live in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope.
