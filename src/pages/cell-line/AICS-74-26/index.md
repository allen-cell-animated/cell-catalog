      caption: "Single mid-level plane of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged nucleophosmin. Right panel is the same image as the left but with contrast enhanced to visualize dimmer localization in mitotic cells. Images are maximum intensity projections through the volume of the cells. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5µm. "
