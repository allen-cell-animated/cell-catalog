      caption: "Localization of mEGFP expressed from a safe harbor locus in hiPSC colony. mEGFP localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Spaces between cells appear dark. Weaker intensity is observed in the nucleolus within the nucleus. The bright spots are dead cells on top of the colony. Some variation in intensity levels is seen between cells. Image is a maximum intensity projection of a 3D spinning disk confocal z-stack of a live hiPSC colony. "

  junction_table_caption: "PCR amplified 3' junction was used to establish delivery via HDR at the intended genomic locus. Tiled junctions were not possible to amplify or sequence due to the large size of the delivered sequence (5KB). The precise sequence of the delivered sequence was not determined because the mEGFP tag sequence was not fused to an endogenous coding sequence."
