    - caption: Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged
        proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). A single, mid-level plane of
        the cells was imaged every 3 min on a spinning-disk confocal microscope.
        Movie plays at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm.

    - caption: Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged proliferating
        cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk
        confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at
        the top. Scale bar, 5µm.
