    - caption: Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Ras
        GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP-1) under oxidative
        stress. Cells were imaged every 1 minute on a spinning-disk confocal
        microscope starting four minutes after the introduction of 62.5 µM
        sodium arsenite. A single, mid-level plane is shown at low contrast
        (left) and high contrast (right). Movie plays at 2700x real time. Scale
        bar, 5 µm.

    - caption: Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Ras
        GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP-1). A single,
        mid-level plane of the cells was imaged every 3 min on a spinning-disk
        confocal microscope. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 20 µm.

    - caption: Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Ras
        GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP-1) in control cells
        (left panel) and cells in the presence of 62.5 µM sodium arsenite for 60
        minutes (right panel). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk
        confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at
        the top. Scale bar, 5µm.

        GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP-1). A single,
        mid-level plane of the cells was imaged every 3 min on a spinning-disk
        confocal microscope. Movie plays at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm.
