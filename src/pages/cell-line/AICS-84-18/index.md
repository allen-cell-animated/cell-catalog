      caption: "Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin and mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin. Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin (left) and nucleophosmin (middle) and the overlay of the two (right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin and mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin. The region bounded by a dashed line is shown at the same scale with enhanced contrast to highlight changes in localization during mitosis. A single, mid-level plane of the cells was imaged every 3 min on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie plays at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."

Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin (left) and nucleophosmin (middle) and the overlay of the two (right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. Frames are maximum intensity z-projections through the entire volume of the cell. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 20 µm."
