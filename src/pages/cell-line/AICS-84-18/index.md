      caption: "Single mid-level plane of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged nucleophosmin. Right panel is the same image as the left but with contrast enhanced to visualize dimmer localization in mitotic cells. Images are maximum intensity projections through the volume of the cells. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5µm. "

      caption: "Z-stack of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin and mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin. Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin (left) and nucleophosmin (middle) and the overlay of the two (right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin and mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin. The region bounded by a dashed line is shown at the same scale with enhanced contrast to highlight changes in localization during mitosis. A single, mid-level plane of the cells was imaged every 3 min on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie plays at 900x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged fibrillarin and mTagRFP-T-tagged nucleophosmin. Panels show individual channels for fibrillarin (left) and nucleophosmin (middle) and the overlay of the two (right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 3 min. Frames are maximum intensity z-projections through the entire volume of the cell. Movie plays at 1800x real time. Scale bar, 20 µm."
