      caption: "Single, mid-level plane of cells in a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Sec61 beta and mTagRFP-T-tagged lamin B1. Panels show individual channels for Sec61 beta (left) and lamin B1 (middle) and the overlay of the two (right). Imaged region captures cells at different stages of the cell cycle to highlight cell cycle-dependent variation in co-localization of Sec61 beta and Lamin B1. Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Scale bar, 5 µm. "

      caption: "Z-stack of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Sec61 beta and mTagRFP-T-tagged lamin B1. Panels show individual channels for Sec61 beta (left) and lamin B1 (middle) and the overlay of the two (right). Cells were imaged in 3D on a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Movie starts at the bottom of the cells and ends at the top. Scale bar, 5µm."

      caption: "Time-lapse movie of a live hiPS cell colony expressing mEGFP-tagged Sec61 beta and mTagRFP-T-tagged lamin B1. Panels show individual channels for Sec61 beta (left) and lamin B1 (middle) and the overlay of the two (right). A single, mid-level plane was imaged on a spinning-disk confocal microscope every 5 min. Movie plays at 3000x real time. Scale bar, 5 µm."
