      caption: One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK
        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw - refer to culture protocol). Cultures
        were observed daily. Colonies were imaged one, four and five days
        post-thaw using a Leica microscope 4x and 10x magnification. A four
        panel image of clone 57 is shown here and is a representative image for
        all clones in the collection (except clone 89). Viability and colony
        formation one day and four days post-thaw. Scale bars are shown.

        days post-thaw. This cell line may exhibit transient poor morphology in
        the first three passages post-thaw. However, this sub-optimal phenotype
        resolves with continued passage. Scale bars are shown.
