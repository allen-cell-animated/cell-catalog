    - caption: "Immunofluorescent labeling of clones 23 and 39 to demonstrate
        expression of progerin proteins. hiPSCs were differentiated using the
        StemDIFF Endothelial Differentiation Kit (StemCell Technologies cat. No.
        08005). Cells were cryopreserved in CryoStor CS10 (StemCell Technologies
        cat. No. 100-1061), and subsequently thawed into STEMdiff™ Endothelial
        Expansion Medium Kit (Catalog #08007) onto plastic tissue culture plates
        coated with Animal Component-Free Cell Attachment Substrate. Cells were
        passaged according to the provided protocol onto plastic tissue culture
        plates until Passage 7, at which point they were plated onto glass
        coated with Animal Component-Free Cell Attachment Substrate. After 4
        days of culture the cells were fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS
        solution. Cells were then blocked and permeabilized in a solution of
        1.5% normal goat serum + 0.4% Triton-100x in PBS for 1 hour at RT. Cells
        were labeled with an anti-progerin antibody (Santa Cruz cat. No.
        sc-81611, diluted 1:60) overnight at 4C. The following day cells were
        labeled with anti-mouse AlexaFluor594 (ThermoFisher cat. No. A-11005,
        diluted 1:500) for 1 hour at RT. Cells were imaged on a widefield
        microscope. All scale bars are 100um."

    - caption: One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK
        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw - refer to culture protocol). Cultures
        were observed daily. Colonies were imaged one and four days post-thaw
        using a Leica microscope at 4x and 10x magnification. A four panel image
        of clone 10 is shown here and is also a representative image for clone
        39 (not pictured). Viability and colony formation one day and four days
        post-thaw. Scale bars are shown.

        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw - refer to culture protocol). Cultures
        were observed daily. Colonies were imaged one and five days post-thaw
        using a Leica microscope at 4x and 10x magnification. A four panel image
        of clone 23 is shown here. Viability and colony formation one day and
        five days post-thaw. Scale bars are shown.
