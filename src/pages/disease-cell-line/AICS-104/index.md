      caption: One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK
        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw - refer to culture protocol). Cultures
        were observed daily. Colonies were imaged one, four and five days
        post-thaw using a Leica microscope 4x and 10x magnification. A six panel
        image of clone 85 (H251N/wt) is shown here and is a representative image
        for all clones in the collection (except clone 4). Viability and colony
        formation one day and four days post-thaw. Scale bars are shown.

        poor morphology in the first three passages post thaw. Scale bars are
        shown.
