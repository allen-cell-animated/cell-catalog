    - caption: "Live-cell imaging of skeletal muscle from the MYH3 G769V collection
        (Clone 82). Cells express mEGFP-tagged alpha-actinin-2. After 35 days of
        primary differentiation from hiPSC to myogenic progenitors, cells were
        replated onto Matrigel coated cover glass and induced to differentiate
        into skeletal muscle. Cells were imaged 11 days after this replating on
        a spinning disk confocal microscope. Images were acquired in a 3 x 3
        tiled Z stack and are presented as maximum intensity projections of 10
        slices. Scale bars are 50µm. Image system details: Nikon Eclipse Ti
        microscope with a Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning disk head imaging onto an
        Andor iXon 888 EMCCD. Objectives were either Nikon Plan Apo VC 60x/1.4
        NA or Nikon Plan Apo 100x/1.4 NA. Skeletal muscle sample and images was

        PhD Institute for Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine (ISCRM) at the
        University of Washington."

    - caption: One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK
        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw - refer to culture protocol). Cultures
        were observed daily. Colonies were imaged one and four days post-thaw
        using a Leica microscope 4x and 10x magnification. A four panel image of
        clone 44 is shown here and is a representative image for all clones in
        the collection (except clone 23 and 30). Viability and colony formation
        one day and four days post-thaw. Scale bars are shown.

        were observed daily. Colonies were imaged one and four days post-thaw

        days post-thaw. May take up to five days to recover post-thaw (Day 5
        image not shown). Scale bars are shown.

      caption: Sanger Sequencing was performed on MYH7 recombinant and wildtype
        alleles. Results confirmed respective genotype as indicated in table
        above with no additional mutations present.

    - title: Karyotype Analysis
      caption: After cells banks were created, one vial per clone was thawed and 30
        G-banded metaphase cells were karyotyped. Above is the representative
        analysis for clone 44. All clones resulted in normal karyotype.
