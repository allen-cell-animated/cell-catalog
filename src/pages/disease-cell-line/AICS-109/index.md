    - caption: One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK
        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw - refer to culture protocol). Cultures
        were observed daily. Colonies were imaged one and four days post-thaw
        using a Leica microscope 4x and 10x magnification. A four panel image of
        clone 93 is shown here and is a representative image for all clones in
        the collection. Viability and colony formation one day and four days
        post-thaw. Scale bars are shown.
