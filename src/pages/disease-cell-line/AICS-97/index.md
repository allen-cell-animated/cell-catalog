      caption: "Live-cell imaging of cardiomyocytes with the G256E point mutation in
        the MYH7 locus introduced into the AICS-0075 cell line (which expresses
        mEGFP-tagged alpha-actinin-2). Twelve days after the onset of
        differentiation, cells were plated on PEI and laminin coated glass and
        imaged in 3D on a spinning disk confocal microscope 18 days later (30
        days total after the onset of differentiation). A. clone 113 (wt/wt) and
        B. clone 141 (G256E/wt). Images are maximum intensity projections of 3 Z
        slices. Scale bar 10Âµm. Image system details: 3i (Denver, CO) spinning
        disk microscope with a Zeiss (Thornwood, NY) 63x/1.2 NA alpha-plan
        APOCHROMAT water objective, a CSU-W1 Yokogawa (Sugar Land, TX) spinning
        disk head, and Hammamatsu (Hammamatsu City, Japan) Orca Flash 4.0
        camera."

      caption: One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK
        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw - refer to culture protocol). Cultures
        were observed daily. Colonies were imaged one and four days post-thaw
        using a Leica microscope 4x and 10x magnification. A four panel image of
        clone 141 (G256E/wt) is shown here. Viability and colony formation one
        day and four days post-thaw. Scale bars are shown.
