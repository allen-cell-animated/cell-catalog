    - caption: "One vial of distribution lot was thawed (cells were treated with ROCK
        inhibitor for 24hrs post-thaw - refer to culture protocol). Cultures
        were observed daily. Colonies were imaged one, four and five days
        post-thaw using a Leica microscope 4x and 10x magnification. A four
        panel image of clone 88 is shown here and is a representative image for
        all clones in the collection. Viability and colony formation one day and
        four days post-thaw. Scale bars are shown. "
