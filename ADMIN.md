1. **Login to the Admin CMS**: Open your web browser and navigate to the admin CMS URL. Use github to sign in.

2. **Before you start**: Before you add a new cell line you need to make sure you have already added:
   1. **the disease** the cell line is modeling. If you it is not yet in the database, go to the section on adding a disease and then continue here.  
   2. **the parental/base cell line**. If it is not yet in the database, go to the section on adding a cell line and then continue here. 

3. **Add New Disease Cell Line**: Look for a button or link labeled 'Add New', 'Create New', 'New Disease Cell Line' or similar. Click on it to start the process of adding a new disease cell line.

4. **Enter Disease Cell Line Details**: You will likely be presented with a form to fill out with the details of the new disease cell line. This might include fields like 'Name', 'Description', 'Associated Diseases', 'Research Notes', etc. Fill out all the necessary fields with the correct information.

5. **Save the New Disease Cell Line**: Once you've filled out all the necessary information, look for a button or link labeled 'Save', 'Create', 'Submit', or similar. Click on it to save the new disease cell line.

6. **Verify the New Disease Cell Line**: After saving, you should be redirected to a page showing all disease cell lines, including the new one. Verify that all the information is correct. If there are any errors, look for an 'Edit' button or link to go back and correct any mistakes.

Remember, the exact steps and labels might vary depending on the specifics of your CMS. If you have any trouble, refer to your CMS's documentation or contact your CMS's support team.
